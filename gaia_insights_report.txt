================================================================================

üìä OVERALL STATISTICS:
   ‚Ä¢ Total stars analyzed: 143,992
   ‚Ä¢ Distance range: 5.0 - 13.0 kpc
   ‚Ä¢ Number of distance bins: 5

üåå GALACTIC STRUCTURE INSIGHTS:
   ‚Ä¢ Peak star density occurs at 9.0 kpc
   ‚Ä¢ This suggests the solar neighborhood is well-sampled
   ‚Ä¢ Rotation curve shows significant variation with radius
   ‚Ä¢ Stars are concentrated in a thin disk

üîç DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
   ‚Ä¢ Relatively uniform sampling across distances
   ‚Ä¢ Excellent velocity precision

üî¨ SCIENTIFIC IMPLICATIONS:
   ‚Ä¢ Data suitable for rotation curve analysis
   ‚Ä¢ Can constrain dark matter distribution
   ‚Ä¢ Provides insights into Galactic structure
   ‚Ä¢ Useful for testing modified gravity theories
